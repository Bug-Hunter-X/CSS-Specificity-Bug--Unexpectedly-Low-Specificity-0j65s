The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue where a selector's specificity is unexpectedly low, leading to styles not being applied as intended.  This often happens when dealing with nested selectors and attribute selectors, particularly in complex situations.

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container [type='text'] {
  width: 100%;
  background-color: lightcoral; /* This rule should override the container's styles */
}

input[type='text'] {
  width: 150px;
  background-color: lightgreen; /* This is more specific but might not apply if the container's background is not removed */
}
```

In this example, one might expect the `input[type='text']` selector to always override the styles set for `.container [type='text']`. However, the specificity calculation in CSS may sometimes yield surprising results.
