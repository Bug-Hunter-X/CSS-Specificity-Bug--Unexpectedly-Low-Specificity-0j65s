# CSS Specificity Bug: Unexpectedly Low Specificity

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS specificity issue where a selector's specificity is unexpectedly low, causing styles not to be applied as expected. The issue involves the interplay between nested selectors and attribute selectors, particularly in complex situations where specificity calculations can be tricky. The `bug.css` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.css` provides a solution.

## Problem

In the `bug.css` file, we observe a scenario where a more specific selector (in terms of the intuitive understanding of specificity) does not override styles from a less specific selector. This occurs due to the subtleties in how CSS calculates specificity, which can lead to counterintuitive outcomes.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file addresses this issue by improving selector specificity and demonstrating how to anticipate and fix unexpected specificity behavior. The solution focuses on writing clear and specific CSS rules to ensure styles are applied as intended.
